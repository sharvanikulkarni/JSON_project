'''List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. 

It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then
zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can
put in all kinds of objects in lists.

The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the
context of the for and if clauses which follow it. 

The list comprehension always returns a result list. '''


'''
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    if filter(i):
        new_list.append(expressions(i))  '''

#You can obtain the same thing using list comprehension:

# new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]


#The list comprehension starts with a '[' and ']', to help you remember that the
#result is going to be a list.

# [ expression for item in list if conditional ]

# This is equivalent to:

'''for item in list:
    if conditional:
        expression '''
		
		


#Which corresponds to:

#*result*  = [*transform*    *iteration*         *filter*     ]

#The filter part answers the question if the item should be transformed. '''
#classic way
from ast import comprehension
from hashlib import new


old_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
new_list = []

for i in old_list:
    i = i**2  #power
    new_list.append(i)

print(new_list)

#1) creating a simple list of 10 numbers using Range()
x = [i for i in range(10)]
print(x)


#list comprehension
new_list = [i**2 for i in old_list]
print(new_list)

# Output -[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

#2) creating a list that evaluates an expression

squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)

# Output -[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

#3) creating a list from another list

list1 = [3,4,5]
multiplied = [item*3 for item in list1]
print(multiplied)

#[9,12,15]

# 4) using list comprehension for string manipulation

listofwords = ["this",'is', 'a', 'list', 'of', 'words']
items = [x[0] for x in listofwords]
print(items)

# Output - ['t', 'i', 'a', 'l', 'o', 'w']

# 5) Let's show how easy you can convert lower case / upper case letters.
lower = [x.lower() for x in ["A", "B", "C"]]
print(lower)

#Output 1 - ['a', 'b', 'c']

upper = [x.upper() for x in lower]
print(upper)
# Output 2 - ['A', 'B', 'C']


#6) Creating a list based on a condition

new_range = [i*i for i in range(5) if i%2==0]
print(new_range)

#Output - [0, 4, 16]




# 7) Extracting numbers only from a string and putting it in a list

string = 'Hello 12345 World'
just_numbers = [i for i in string if i.isdigit()]
print(just_numbers)
alpha = [i for i in string if i.isalpha()]
print(alpha)
# Output - ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']

''' 
In this example, we can see how to get specific lines out from a text file. 

Create a text file and put in some text in it. 

this is line1
this is line2
this is line3
this is line4
this is line5

Save the file as test.txt '''

fl = open('test.txt', 'r')
result = [i for i in fl if "line3" in i]
result1 = [i.strip("\n") for i in fl if "line3" in i]
print(result)
print(result1)


#Output: ['this is line3']



#9) Using functions in list comprehension

# Create a function and name it double:
def double(x):
    return x*2

# If you now just print that function with a value in it, it should look like this:

print(double(10))

# Answer - 20


#We can easily use list comprehension on that function.

output = [double(x) for x in range(10)]
print(output)


# Output - [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]



# 10) adding an IF condition to the above

output = [double(x) for x in range(10) if x%2==0]
print(output)



# Output - [0, 4, 8, 12, 16]






# 11) You can add more arguments (using multiple iterators and lists):

answer = [x+y for x in [10,20,30] for y in [20,40,60]]
print(answer)

#it does each element of x with each element of y

# Output - [30, 50, 70, 50, 70, 90, 70, 90, 110]
